// Static arrays have fixed size - specific amount of memory is allocated for the array

// Dynamic arrays have flexible size - new array is created and old array is
// copied into the new array with the larger size

// Arrays in languages like javascript or python are automatically treated like
// dynamic arrays.  This differs from languages such as C++ where arrays are
// treated like static arrays.
